# Generate PR Description

Generate a concise GitHub PR description in markdown format with the following structure:

1. **Description section** (< 100 words, or < 120 words if explaining complex changes): Brief explanation of what was implemented/changed and why
2. **Technical Details** (if applicable): Explanation of complicated code changes or architectural decisions
3. **Note section** (if applicable): Any dependencies, requirements, or follow-up tasks needed
4. **Testing Checklist**: 5-7 actionable test items using `- [ ]` checkbox format

## Requirements:

- Keep description under 100 words (can extend to 120 words if explaining complex technical changes)
- If code changes involve complex patterns, new architecture, or non-obvious implementations, add a Technical Details section
- Include relevant testing URLs or tools (e.g., Facebook Debugger for OG tags)
- Make checklist items specific and actionable
- Include both happy path and error/fallback scenario tests
- If external dependencies exist (API keys, translations, etc.), mention them in a **Note**

## Format:

```markdown
## Description

[Brief description of changes and their purpose - up to 120 words if complex]

## Technical Details

[Only include if there are complex patterns or architectural decisions to explain]

- [Key implementation detail or pattern used]
- [Why this approach was chosen]
- [Any tradeoffs or considerations]

**Note:** [Any dependencies or follow-up tasks, if applicable]

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] [Specific test action]
- [ ] [Test with tool/URL]
- [ ] [Error case test]
- [ ] [Visual/UI verification]
- [ ] [Integration test]
```

Analyze the current changes in the repository and generate an appropriate PR description following this format.

**IMPORTANT:** Write the generated PR description to a new file called `pr-description.md` in the current directory using the Write tool. Do not just print it to the console.
Then inform the user where the file is located and ask them to review it and add it to the PR.
